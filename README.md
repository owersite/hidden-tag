# Invisible Tag Discord Exploit
### Description
This Exploit gives you ability to tag people without them seeing the tag. (You can do @Guy / @everyone / @here)
So basicly people will not be able to see tag in message you're sending.

# Examples

### Notice

Invisible Tag Exploit is officially fixed by me!
